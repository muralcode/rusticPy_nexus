## Rust-Powered Data Processing Pipeline

This project demonstrates the power of combining Rust and Python to create a high-performance data processing pipeline. It uses Rust for computationally intensive tasks and Python for orchestration and data manipulation.
Usees best practices, ensuring each service is modular and follows a clear, maintainable structure. The addition of the AI model creation service allows for advanced data analysis and model training, showcasing the full potential of combining Python and Rust in a microservice architecture.

## Implementation
There is a much more powerful production ready machine learning data processing pipeline custom AI version of this concept using realitic data sets and Rust handling all expensive computational algorithms. This is just a basic overview of how to accomplish a scalable high-performance data processing pipeline.
Im more than happy to share upon request.
